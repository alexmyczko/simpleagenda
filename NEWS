version 0.36
	* Calendar UI changes : to reduce calendar size, use different
	  visual hints. Today has a yellow background (unchanged), the 
	  selected day cell is bezeled/pushed (was a bold font) and busy 
	  days use a bold font (instead of a tick mark). Always show six 
	  weeks with black text for the chosen month and white text for 
	  the previous and next ones. Use a defined font size so that it 
	  all fits whatever the user choose as a default size.
	* Day view : circle through appointments with TAB and edit the 
	  selected one with enter
	* Change license for future GNUstep GPLv3 release compatibility
	  Thanks to Yavor Doganov for pointing out the issue.

version 0.34 (2007/12/13)
