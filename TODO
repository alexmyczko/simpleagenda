In no particular order :

* iCalendar write support (almost there, the networking part is working)

* better user preferences (agenda creation/deletion)

* recurrent events

* alerts and user notification (visual, by mail etc)

* remove ChronographerSource dependency and use libical for local
   stores ?

* redo user defaults, current code is ugly

* snap events to defined time intervals

* use configure to detect libical ?

* use bundles for backend ?
