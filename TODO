In no particular order :

* fix global data flow and use of notifications/delegate

* use libical component as a base for Event class

* support iCalendar VTODO components ?

* better user preferences (agenda creation/deletion)

* alerts and user notification (visual, by mail etc)

* AppointmentCache is a bad idea, rip it off
