In no particular order :

* iCalendar write support (almost there, the networking part is
   working)

* support iCalendar VTODO components ?

* better user preferences (agenda creation/deletion)

* alerts and user notification (visual, by mail etc)

* remove ChronographerSource dependency and use libical for local
   stores

* redo user defaults, current code is ugly
